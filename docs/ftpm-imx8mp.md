# fTPM (firmware TPM) on i.MX8MP EVK

This document describes how to build the Yocto image with the Microsoft
firmware TPM (`ms-tpm-20-ref`) running as an OP-TEE trusted application, and
how to exercise it from Linux with `tpm2-tools`.

## Overview

* The fTPM is a TPM 2.0 reference implementation packaged as an OP-TEE TA
  (UUID `bc50d971-d4c9-42c4-82cb-343fb7f37896`). `meta-arm` ships the recipe
  (`optee-ftpm`) and, when the `optee-ftpm` machine feature is set, links the
  TA into the OP-TEE OS image as an **early TA** (`CFG_EARLY_TA=y`), so it is
  available without loading anything from the normal world.
* On the Linux side the `tpm_ftpm_tee` driver exposes it as a standard
  `/dev/tpm0` character device.

`meta-arm` gates the recipe to QEMU/`genericarm64` machines. This layer
adds the following bbappends and patches:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `recipes-security/optee-ftpm/optee-ftpm_%.bbappend` | Allow `imx8mpevk` (`COMPATIBLE_MACHINE`) and build the TA as AArch64 |
| `recipes-kernel/linux/linux-imx_%.bbappend` + `linux-imx/ftpm.cfg` | Build the `tpm_ftpm_tee` driver into the i.MX kernel (`CONFIG_TCG_FTPM_TEE=y`) together with IMA, and keep Linux off the on-board eMMC (only when the `optee-ftpm` machine feature is set) |
| `recipes-security/optee/optee-os_%.imx.bbappend` | Build the OP-TEE core uSDHC driver and the native RPMB backend (`attester/optee-patches/`) into OP-TEE, and make RPMB the only private storage (`CFG_REE_FS=n`) |
| `recipes-bsp/u-boot/`, `recipes-bsp/imx-atf/` | Keep U-Boot off the on-board eMMC; make uSDHC3 a secure bus master in BL31 |

## Enabling the fTPM

Add to `conf/local.conf` (on top of the normal attestation configuration —
the file lives at `${YOCTO_DIR}/build/conf/local.conf` on the host):

```
MACHINE_FEATURES:append = " optee-ftpm"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " optee-ftpm tpm2-tools libtss2-tcti-device"
```

Then rebuild. The `bitbake` commands below run inside the `yocto.sh` build
container; if you have built before, editing `local.conf` and re-running
`YOCTO_DIR=... ./yocto.sh full` performs the same sequence (its own config
appends are grep-guarded and will not clobber these edits). Because the fTPM is embedded into the OP-TEE OS binary,
`imx-boot` must be regenerated after `optee-os` changes, and the image
repacked (the same sequence `yocto.sh full` uses):

```
bitbake core-image-minimal
bitbake -c cleansstate imx-boot && bitbake imx-boot
bitbake -f -c image core-image-minimal
```

For a HAB-signed board, sign the resulting image as usual with
`secure-boot-imx8mp.sh` (see the secure-boot guide).

## How the fTPM starts before Linux

The fTPM keeps its persistent state in the RPMB partition of the on-board
eMMC. In stock OP-TEE that traffic is relayed by `tee-supplicant`, so the TA
could only start once user space was up, long after IMA had looked for a TPM
and given up. With the `optee-ftpm` feature this layer instead:

* builds an eMMC controller driver for uSDHC3 into the OP-TEE core
  (`attester/optee-patches/imx_usdhc.c`) and routes `tee_rpmb_fs.c` to it
  (`rpmb-native-backend.py`), so RPMB is reachable with no help from Linux;
* makes RPMB the only private storage (`CFG_REE_FS=n`) and lets the TA
  enumerate at OP-TEE driver probe instead of waiting for the supplicant;
* gives the on-board eMMC to the TEE: uSDHC3 is disabled in the U-Boot and
  Linux device trees, BL31 configures it as a secure bus master with
  secure-only registers, and the shared `nand_usdhc_bus` clock is kept
  running by the kernel.

The result is that `/dev/tpm0` exists during kernel init and IMA anchors its
measurement log in the fTPM (PCR 10). Nothing needs to be loaded after boot.

**First boot on a device.** With `CFG_RPMB_WRITE_KEY=y`, OP-TEE programs the
RPMB authentication key the first time it finds none. This happens once per
eMMC and cannot be undone (the key is derived from the CAAM master key and
the eMMC CID, so it never has to be stored). The fTPM then creates its NV
storage, which takes a few seconds more than a normal boot.

## Using the fTPM on the device

```sh
dmesg | grep -iE "tpm|ima:"      # no "No TPM chip found"; no tpm0 errors
ls /dev/tpm0
tpm2_getcap properties-fixed   # manufacturer/firmware info
tpm2_pcrread sha256:10         # non-zero once IMA has measured
```

## Caveats

* **The eMMC belongs to the TEE.** This arrangement assumes U-Boot and Linux
  never use the on-board eMMC, which holds on the EVK because it boots from
  SD. A product that boots from its only eMMC, or uses it as Linux storage,
  needs a different design (a separate TEE storage device, or a volatile
  fTPM seeded from CAAM).
* **RPMB key programming is irreversible.** See "First boot on a device".
* **Boot firmware is not measured.** IMA measures from kernel start; U-Boot
  and the kernel are not extended into the PCRs (HAB secure boot and the RA
  PRoT measurement cover them). IMA measures only `boot_aggregate` until a
  policy is loaded (`CONFIG_IMA_WRITE_POLICY=y` allows that at runtime).
* With the feature enabled, the `meta-arm` bbappend pins `CFG_CORE_HEAP_SIZE`
  to 128 KiB — the fTPM needs more TEE core heap than OP-TEE's generic
  64 KiB default. On i.MX this is a no-op: the NXP tree already defaults all
  i.MX platforms to 128 KiB.
